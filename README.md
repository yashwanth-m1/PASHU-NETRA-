PROBLEM STATEMENT : IMAGED BASED ANIMAL TYPE CLASSIFICATION FOR CATTLE AND BUFFALOES 

IDEA DESCRIPTION :PASHU-NETRA is an AI-powered solution designed to automate the Animal Type Classification (ATC) of cattle and buffaloes by analyzing images to extract body structure traits, generate standardized scores, and seamlessly record results into the Bharat Pashudhan App. This system eliminates human error and bias, saves time and costs by reducing dependence on trained personnel, and provides predictive insights into productivity, milk yield, and longevity. With features like offline mode with auto-sync, instant visual feedback, trend analysis, and alerts, it ensures easy usability for field staff using smartphones or tablets. Built on technologies like ReactJS, NodeJS, Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, PASHU-NETRA offers a feasible, cost-effective, and non-invasive approach that enhances government livestock programs, supports farmers in better decision-making, and boosts overall dairy productivity while promoting AI adoption in agriculture.
